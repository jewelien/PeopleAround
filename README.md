##### Problem 
When you’re at an event or gathering full of random people and you want to know the people around you, open “People Around”.  Call out their name and introduce yourself. Choose what information to share limited to the location you specify.  Share your name, photo, title, location.

##### Ideal Customers (personas). 
- Michael -goes to a lot of meetups and events meeting with different random people he’s never met before. Would like to easily  see who is around in the same event and see if he would like to connect with them. 
- Michelle - is planning a big event and need to lead a group of people with different roles for the event. She wants to be able to track where they are at individually and be able to find them easily if needed. 
- Flea Market/Booths events - there are different services in the area in different booths there is not a map of the area. Individual stores can mark where their booth is located and users with the app would easily be able to find their location.
